                            Cricket Counter uses iCloud and WatchConnectivity to sync your match data between iPhone and Apple Watch in real-time. Your iPhone acts as the primary device, and all changes sync automatically. Make sure both devices are signed in to the same Apple ID and have Bluetooth enabled.

                            In cricket, you can take wickets on wide balls and no-balls. Long-press the "+Wicket" button to access options for "Wide + Wicket" or "No-Ball + Wicket". This records both the extra delivery and the wicket in one action, just like real cricket scoring.

                            Cricket Counter maintains a 24-level undo/redo system that preserves complete game state. This includes overs, balls, wickets, and delivery history. Even complex actions like undoing after "over complete" properly restores the previous over state with full delivery history.

                            All Premium subscription management is handled through the App Store. On your iPhone, go to Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions > Cricket Counter to view, modify, or cancel your Premium subscription. You can also access this from the App Store app by tapping your profile icon and selecting "Subscriptions". The free version with ads requires no subscription management.

                            Premium subscription removes all advertisements from Cricket Counter, providing a completely ad-free scoring experience. You get the same powerful features (unlimited matches, cross-device sync, 24-level undo, wickets-on-extras) without any banner or interstitial ads. Premium also supports ongoing development of new features.

                            To remove all ads, upgrade to Premium through the app. Tap the settings icon, select "Remove Ads", and choose the monthly subscription. You can also upgrade from any paywall screen that appears. This immediately removes all banner and interstitial advertisements.

                            Yes, you can cancel your Premium subscription at any time through the App Store. Go to Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions > Cricket Counter and tap "Cancel Subscription". You'll continue to have ad-free access until the end of your current billing period, then the app will return to the free version with ads.
